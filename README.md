# Classical Elements
An SVG icon system of classical elements

* Earth
* Wind
* Fire
* Water
* Ã†ther
* Terra (new)

This was forked from the instructor's [repository](https://github.com/jclayton/classical-elements) of classical elements icons. I added the Terra icon that I made with Adobe Illustrator. Its design is from this [image](http://www.casualgameguides.com/games/includes/fatal_hearts/safe2.png) of classical elements I found on the Internet.
